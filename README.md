# Backwords Game
Welcome to the wonderful world of Backwords!

It's a simple game where:
1. One player "The Leader" records a phrase (E.g. they speak "Hello, my name is Finlay"). 
The other players should not hear this. You should go in another room etc.

2. This sound is then reversed - it will sound like gibberish
The other players listen to the reversed sound and record their impression of it

3. The players' recording are then reversed and _should_ sound like "The Leader's" original recording!

4. Fun WILL be had by all... or else!


## The Details!
- It's based on create-react-app
- You can run it locally using `npm install && npm start`
- It's also hosted on Netlify here: https://backwords-game.netlify.app/

- There's a lot more that could be done with it - feel free to PR!
